# SE Project : Sprint 2
\

















## Frontend Work Summary
As mentioned in [Discussion #49](https://github.com/timelygator/TimelyGator/discussions/49)
### Main Goals
- Completing Sprint 1 Tasks
  - Address any pending UI/UX improvements.
  - Refactor code where necessary for better maintainability.
- Working with APIs & Data Display
  - Fetch and display data correctly in respective fields or StatBox components.
  - Ensure proper error handling and loading states.
- Setting Up Dependencies
  - Install and configure required testing libraries.
  - Set up necessary state management or API-handling tools.
- Frontend-Backend Integration
  - Connect the frontend with the backend API.
  - Ensure proper data flow between the two.
  - Debug and fix any API-related issues.
- Testing
  - Write a simple test using Cypress to validate key workflows.
  - Implement unit tests for frontend components, aiming for a 1:1 test-to-function ratio.
- Additional Suggested Tasks:
  - Ensure consistent coding styles across the frontend.
  - Add documentation for key components and API usage.

### Completed Tasks
- Codebase cleanup carried over from Sprint 1.
- Set up API templates to fetch data.
- As full integration could not be reached in this sprint, API placeholders were added to respective files for future integration.
#### Testing
- Configured Cypress testing and created related `.cy` files to achieve 1:1 testing, covering:
  1. Mounting of all components.
  2. Sidebar collapsing and expanding behavior.
  3. On-hover functionality of StatCard.
  4. Line graph, bar graph, and pie chart animations.
  5. Search functionality of TabTable.
  6. Toggle functionality on the settings page.
  7. Button click functionality on the settings page.

### Next Steps
- Achieve full frontend-backend integration in the next sprint.
- Begin end-to-end (E2E) testing to ensure seamless user workflows.
